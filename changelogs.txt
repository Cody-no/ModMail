* Added support for \n escape sequences in custom help option open/close messages so multi-line notices can be entered via slash commands.
* Ensured help options that create their own forums open tickets inside those forums and keep tags/cleanup in sync.
* Extended `/helpoption add` with custom tag names, emoji, and on-demand forum channel creation that inherits the configured category permissions.
* Allowed help option labels to stretch to 100 characters, wiring emoji into the dropdown and forum tags so longer names keep their metadata intact.
* Reworked `/translation edit` so moderators choose a language and update each help prompt message from a single modal.
* Added ticket open/close message fields to the translation edit modal so lifecycle notices can be localised alongside prompts.
* Guarded translation prompts with explicit markers so user-provided text cannot inject instructions into OpenAI requests.
* Cached translated phrases in `translations.json` so repeated prompts reuse prior AI results automatically.
* Localised the automatic ticket open and close messages using the detected ticket language with cache fallbacks.
* Added a `/translation edit` modal command for moderators to review and adjust saved translations inside Discord.
* Localised help option dropdown labels and acknowledgement replies so intake flows match each ticket's detected language.
* Added language-aware ticket intake that prompts users to categorise requests before forwarding their first message, with dropdowns expiring after three days and updated help option metadata (optional roles and descriptors).
* Restored the "DM to Contact Mods" status by switching to discord.CustomActivity so it appears reliably.
* Fixed translated ticket closure logs so the reason shows both the translated and original text correctly.
* Sent ticket closure DMs before transcript generation so users receive the "Ticket Closed" notice without delay.
* Removed the forum ticket counter so the forum name no longer changes as tickets open or close.
* Fixed group tag cleanup to remain compatible with discord.py versions that do not expose `ForumChannel.delete_tag`.
* Simplified configuration loading to avoid syntax errors seen on Windows deployments when constructing the `Config` object.
* Added shared group-reply helper and expanded the command set with `!areplymany`, `!replytmany`, and `!areplytmany` for anonymous and translated follow-ups.
* Introduced `!aclosemany`, `!clostmany`/`!closetmany`, and `!aclosetmany` so bulk closures can be anonymous or translated while keeping forum tags tidy.
* Hardened the error handler to skip missing error channels gracefully and ensure the owner always receives stack traces.
* Forced `config.json` to load with UTF-8 so automated ticket messages preserve emoji and other non-ASCII characters.
* Delayed temporary tag cleanup until after ticket deletion and report failures so moderators know when manual intervention is required.
* Documented the `!sendmany`, `!replymany`, and `!closemany` group workflow in the README so moderators know how to use the new commands.
* Removed the broadcast forum workflow and its commands in favor of simpler group-tag automation.
* Added `!sendmany`, `!replymany`, and `!closemany` commands for sending, replying, and closing groups of tickets via temporary tags.
* Added per-help-option opening messages and auto-close messages when users pick a help option.
* Persisted group tag membership in the database and clean up tags automatically when tickets close.
* Refactored ticket closure into a reusable helper so every close path shares the same logging, transcript, and DM flow.
* Ensured newly created ticket threads are fetched before use so the first DM no longer fails with Unknown Channel errors.
* Reduced the delay on opening DMs by scheduling forum title updates asynchronously and preventing them from blocking ticket creation.
* Fixed the forum title counter so it no longer appends duplicate numbers when Discord slugifies the channel name.
* Added a `!broadcast` command that creates pinned "Send to All" threads, links them to selected tickets, and mirrors every reply across all recipients.
* Restored the dedicated `category_id` config entry so deployments can keep the legacy identifier alongside the new forum channel settings.
* Moved ticket handling to a single forum channel with threads and keep the forum name in sync with the open ticket count.
* Fixed ticket creation to unwrap `ThreadWithMessage` responses so ticket records write correctly on all discord.py versions.
* Updated configuration to use `forum_channel_id` (with legacy support) and refreshed the README/template instructions.
* Archived ticket threads are now treated as closed so a fresh thread is created instead of reopening them, keeping the workflow identical to the old channel-based system.
* Added GPT-4o ticket summary in closed ticket logs.
* Translated incoming messages to English when relayed to moderators.
* Added replyTranslate and areplyTranslate commands for sending translated replies.
* Ensured config, snippet, blacklist, and transcript files use UTF-8 encoding to preserve non-English text without mojibake.
* Added OpenAI dependency for translation and AI summarization features.
* Tokens and API keys now load from a modmail.env file using python-dotenv.
* Corrected OpenAI API calls using AsyncOpenAI client.
* Initialized OpenAI client with httpx.AsyncClient to avoid proxy errors.
* Added closet command for closing tickets with translated reasons.
* Category name now reflects the number of channels as [n/50] and updates on creation or deletion.
* Added language detection before translation to avoid unnecessary English translations.


* Removed unused googletrans import.
* Replaced automatic message translation with a button that translates on demand.
* Translate button view now has no timeout so it remains usable indefinitely.

* Refined translation prompts to remove extra text from responses.
* Translation results are now wrapped with notices to not respond.
* Removed notice text from translation results; notice is used only in prompts.
* Added TRANSLATION_NOTICE constant and inserted it into translation prompts.
* Clarified comments so the translation notice never appears in output.
* Expanded notice comment to emphasize it is excluded from translations.
* Documented `modmail.env` usage in README setup instructions.

* Corrected config key in templates/config.json to `anonymous_tickets` and updated README accordingly.

* Added slash commands to manage help options, prompting users to categorise new tickets and pinging the matching support roles automatically.
* Added a dropdown-driven configuration wizard to update config.json settings from Discord.
* Routed ticket open/close message updates in the config wizard through modals for cleaner editing.

* Notified users when they receive the Voice Manage Roles role.

* Expanded the Voice Manage Roles notification to include a quick list of available actions.
