* Added a `!broadcast` command that creates pinned "Send to All" threads, links them to selected tickets, and mirrors every reply across all recipients.
* Restored the dedicated `category_id` config entry so deployments can keep the legacy identifier alongside the new forum channel settings.
* Moved ticket handling to a single forum channel with threads and keep the forum name in sync with the open ticket count.
* Added validation ensuring the configured modmail log channel is a regular text channel and documented the requirement.
* Updated configuration to use `forum_channel_id` (with legacy support) and refreshed the README/template instructions.
* Archived ticket threads are now treated as closed so a fresh thread is created instead of reopening them, keeping the workflow identical to the old channel-based system.

* Translated incoming messages to English when relayed to moderators.
* Added replyTranslate and areplyTranslate commands for sending translated replies.
* Added OpenAI dependency for translation and AI summarization features.
* Tokens and API keys now load from a modmail.env file using python-dotenv.
* Corrected OpenAI API calls using AsyncOpenAI client.
* Initialized OpenAI client with httpx.AsyncClient to avoid proxy errors.
* Added closet command for closing tickets with translated reasons.
* Category name now reflects the number of channels as [n/50] and updates on creation or deletion.
* Added language detection before translation to avoid unnecessary English translations.


* Removed unused googletrans import.
* Replaced automatic message translation with a button that translates on demand.
* Translate button view now has no timeout so it remains usable indefinitely.

* Refined translation prompts to remove extra text from responses.
* Translation results are now wrapped with notices to not respond.
* Removed notice text from translation results; notice is used only in prompts.
* Added TRANSLATION_NOTICE constant and inserted it into translation prompts.
* Clarified comments so the translation notice never appears in output.
* Expanded notice comment to emphasize it is excluded from translations.
* Documented `modmail.env` usage in README setup instructions.
